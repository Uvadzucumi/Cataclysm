"Q: What is Run Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\n"
"A: Run Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement\n"
"   key down.  When a monster comes into view, your movement will be ignored\n"
"   until Run Mode is turned off with the ! key.  This ensures that the\n"
"   sudden appearence of a monster won't catch you off guard.\n"
"\n"
"Q: It seems like everything I eat makes me sick!  What's wrong?\n"
"A: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable, and will only last a few\n"
"   days after the start of a new game (July 12).  Fruit, milk, and others "
"are\n"
"   the first to go.  After the first couple of days, you should switch to\n"
"   canned food, jerky, and hunting.\n"
"\n"
"Q: Why doesn't reading a book seem to give me any training?\n"
"A: Your skills will not be displayed in the @ screen until they reach level\n"
"   one.  Generally it will take several reads of the same book to gain a\n"
"   single level in a skill.\n"
"\n"
"Q: How can I board up windows and doors?\n"
"A: You'll need a hammer, nails, and two by fours.  Use the hammer and "
"choose\n"
"   the direction in which the terrain you wish to barricade lies.\n"
"\n"
"Q: How can I prevent monsters from attacking while I sleep?\n"
"A: Find a safe place to sleep, in a building far from the front door.  Set\n"
"   traps if you have them, or build a fire."

"Q: Why do I always sink when I try to swim?\n"
"A: Your swimming ability is reduced greatly by the weight you are carrying,\n"
"   and is also adversely affected by the clothing you wear.  Until you "
"reach\n"
"   a high level in the swimming skill, you'll need to drop your equipment "
"and\n"
"   remove your clothing to swim, making it a last-ditch escape plan.\n"
"\n"
"Q: How can I cure a fungal infection?\n"
"A: At present time, there is only one cure, royal jelly.  You can find "
"royal\n"
"   jelly in the bee hives which dot forests.\n"
"\n"
"Q: How do I get into science labs?\n"
"A: You can enter the front door if you have an ID card by 'e'xamining the\n"
"   keypad.  If you are skilled in computers and have an electrohack, it is\n"
"   possible to hack the keypad.  An EMP blast has a chance to force the "
"doors\n"
"   open, but it's more likely to break them.  You can also sneak in through\n"
"   the sewers sometimes, or try to smash through the walls with explosions.\n"
"\n"
"Q: Why does my crafting fail so often?\n"
"A: Check the difficulty of the recipe, and the primary skill used; your "
"skill\n"
"   level should be around one and a half times the difficulty to be "
"confident\n"
"   that it will succeed."

"\n"
"Q: The game just told me to quit, and other weird stuff is happening.\n"
"A: You have the Schizophrenic trait, which might make the game seem buggy.\n"
"\n"
"Q: I have a question that's not addressed here.  How can I get an answer?\n"
